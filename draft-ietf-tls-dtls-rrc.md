--- abstract

This document specifies a return routability check for use in context of the
Connection ID (CID) construct for the Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)
protocol versions 1.2 and 1.3.

# Introduction

In "classical" DTLS, selecting a security context of an incoming DTLS record is
accomplished with the help of the 5-tuple, i.e. source IP address, source port,
transport protocol, destination IP address, and destination port.  Changes to
this 5 tuple can happen for a variety reasons over the lifetime of the DTLS
session.  In the IoT context, NAT rebinding is common with sleepy devices.
Other examples include end host mobility and multi-homing.  Without CID, if the
source IP address and/or source port changes during the lifetime of an ongoing
DTLS session then the receiver will be unable to locate the correct security
context.  As a result, the DTLS handshake has to be re-run.  Of course, it is
not necessary to re-run the full handshake if session resumption is supported
and negotiated.

A CID is an identifier carried in the record layer header of a DTLS datagram
that gives the receiver additional information for selecting the appropriate
security context.  The CID mechanism has been specified in
{{!I-D.ietf-tls-dtls-connection-id}} for DTLS 1.2 and in
{{!I-D.ietf-tls-dtls13}} for DTLS 1.3.

Section 6 of {{!I-D.ietf-tls-dtls-connection-id}} describes how the use of CID
increases the attack surface by providing both on-path and off-path attackers
an opportunity for (D)DoS.  It then goes on describing the steps a DTLS
principal must take when a record with a CID is received that has a source
address (and/or port) different from the one currently associated with the DTLS
connection.  However, the actual mechanism for ensuring that the new peer
address is willing to receive and process DTLS records is left open.  This
document standardizes a return routability check (RRC) as part of the DTLS
protocol itself.

The return routability check is performed by the receiving peer before the
CID-to-IP address/port binding is updated in that peer's session state
database.  This is done in order to provide more confidence to the receiving
peer that the sending peer is reachable at the indicated address and port.

# Conventions and Terminology

{::boilerplate bcp14}

This document assumes familiarity with the CID format and protocol defined for
DTLS 1.2 {{!I-D.ietf-tls-dtls-connection-id}} and for DTLS 1.3
{{!I-D.ietf-tls-dtls13}}.  The presentation language used in this document is
described in Section 4 of {{!RFC8446}}.

# RRC Extension

This specification uses the tls_flags extension defined in {{!I-D.ietf-tls-tlsflags}}
to allow a client and a server to negotiate support for this extension.

The RRC flag is assigned the value (TBD1) and is used in the ClientHello (CH) and
the ServerHello (SH).


# The Return Routability Check Message

When a record with CID is received that has the source address of the enclosing
UDP datagram different from the one previously associated with that CID, the
receiver MUST NOT update its view of the peer's IP address and port number with
the source specified in the UDP datagram before cryptographically validating
the enclosed record(s) but instead perform a return routability check.

        case path_response:  Cookie;
    };
} return_routability_check;
~~~~

The newly introduced return_routability_check message contains a cookie.  The
cookie is a 8-byte field containing arbitrary data.

The return_routability_check message MUST be authenticated and encrypted using
the currently active security context.

The receiver that observes the peer's address and or port update MUST stop
sending any buffered application data (or limit the data sent to a TBD
threshold) and initiate the return routability check that proceeds as follows:

1. A cookie is placed in a return_routability_check message of type
   path_challenge;
1. The message is sent to the observed new address and a timeout T is started;
1. The peer endpoint, after successfully verifying the received
   return_routability_check message echoes the cookie value in a
   return_routability_check message of type path_response;
1. When the initiator receives and verifies the return_routability_check
   message contains the sent cookie, it updates the peer address binding;
1. If T expires, or the address confirmation fails, the peer address binding is
   not updated.

After this point, any pending send operation is resumed to the bound peer
address.

# Example

The example TLS 1.3 handshake shown in {{fig-handshake}} shows a client
and a server negotiating the support for CID and for the RRC extension.

{: #fig-handshake title="Message Flow for Full TLS Handshake"}

Once a connection has been established the client and the server
exchange application payloads protected by DTLS with an unilaterally used
CIDs. In our case, the client is requested to use CID 100 for records
sent to the server.

At some point in the communication interaction the IP address used by
the client changes and, thanks to the CID usage, the security context to
interpret the record is successfully located by the server.  However, the
server wants to test the reachability of the client at his new IP address.

# Security and Privacy Considerations

Note that the return routability checks do not protect against flooding of
third-parties if the attacker is on-path, as the attacker can redirect the
return routability checks to the real peer (even if those datagrams are
cryptographically authenticated).  On-path adversaries can, in general, pose a
harm to connectivity.

# IANA Considerations

IANA is requested to allocate an entry to the TLS "ContentType"
registry, for the return_routability_check(TBD) defined in this document.

IANA is requested to allocate an entry to the TLS Flags registry
in the tls_flags type:

- Value: [[IANA please assign a value from the 32-63 value range.]]

- Flag Name: RRC

- Message: CH,SH

- Recommended: Y

- Reference: [[This document]]
